## Hand_written_digit_classification
In this project, I tried to get a deep understanding of supervised learning with various different models.
Various work which I have done during this project is as follows:
 1. We use the MNIST dataset here
 2. IN the first step we do binary classification to distinguish 5 from others using the SGD classifier. Measure performance using CV and CM.
 3. We also analyze precision, recall, and F1 scores by using graphs(like ROC) and get a much better understanding of these.
 4. Now we do multiclass classification here we distinguish all the classes separately. We use SGD, Random Forest Classifier here.
 5. Here we also know the major difference between oneVsONeCLassifeir and One VsRestClassifer
 6. Also do multilabel classification which classifies multiple digits at a time.
 7. Lastly we do multioutput-multiclass classification.
